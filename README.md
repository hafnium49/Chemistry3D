Chemistry3D is an advanced chemistry simulation laboratory leveraging the capabilities of IsaacSim. This platform offers a comprehensive suite of both organic and inorganic chemical experiments, which can be conducted in a simulated environment. One of the distinguishing features of Chemistry3D is its ability to facilitate robotic operations within these experiments. The primary objective of this simulation environment is to provide a robust and reliable testing ground for both experimental procedures and the application of robotics within chemical laboratory settings.

The development of this system aims to integrate chemical experiment simulation with robotic simulation environments, thereby enabling the visualization of chemical experiments while facilitating the simulation of realistic robotic operations. This environment supports the advancement of embodied intelligence for robots, the execution of reinforcement learning tasks, and other robotic operations. Through this integrated environment, we aspire to seamlessly combine chemical experiment simulation with robotic simulation, ultimately creating a comprehensive test environment for the entire chemical experimentation process.

You can also try this command to run our transparency detection demo:
```bash
omni_python Transparent_Grasp/Isaac/train_network.py
```

# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning in Chemistry3D is based on OmniIsaacGymEnvs, which contains a seires of tasks. To use OmniIsaacGymEnvs, you need to download OmniIsaacGymEnvs to you Isaac-Sim. Please refer to link below.
* [**OmniIsaacGymEnvs**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs)See more details in this link
**PLEASE NOTE:** Version 4.0.0 will be the last release of OmniIsaacGymEnvs. Moving forward, OmniIsaacGymEnvs will be merging with [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab). All future updates will be available as part of the IsaacLab repository.

For tutorials on migrating to IsaacLab, please visit: [IsaacLab Migration Guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/migration/migrating_from_omniisaacgymenvs.html).

# Embodied intelligence
In the Embodied intelligence task, Chenmistry constructs several special agents that enable the addition of motion tasks and the deployment of robot motion. You can refer to this demo
```bash
omni_python LLM/mas_test.py
```
If you have other specific task, you can rewrite your agent and its prompt in LLM/mas.py
